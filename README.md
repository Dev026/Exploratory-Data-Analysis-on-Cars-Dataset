# Cars Dataset EDA Analysis 🚗📊

Welcome to the Cars Dataset EDA Analysis repository! In this code, I've performed a concise Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Cars Dataset. The analysis includes:

## Key Analysis Techniques:

- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and handling outliers in the dataset.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Employing strategies such as dropping missing values to ensure data integrity.
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Utilizing a heatmap to visualize the correlation between each feature.

## Project Highlights:

- **Dataset**: Cars Dataset
- **EDA Methods**: Outlier detection, handling missing values, and heatmap visualization.
- **Insights**: Gain insights into the relationships and patterns within the Cars Dataset.

Feel free to explore the code and discover how outlier detection, handling missing values, and heatmap visualization contribute to a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis. This project serves as a practical example for those looking to understand the basics of analyzing a Cars Dataset.

Happy exploring! 🚗🔍
